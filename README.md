# eww widget Bar written in C

this is meant for the hyprland compositor.

C is really fast. This probably outperforms scripts in Python or other scripting languages 
while providing 3 different scss classes to customize.

* `active`
    * currently active workspace
* 'inactive'
    * workspaces with open windows but not focused
* 'empty'
    * workspaces with nothing in them
